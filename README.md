This Application is a Portfolio for me. As I complete more of the weekly challanges they will end up on this webpage.

I agree with the what you said here about the first repo name, but I was starting a theme to name all my repos after Daft Punk albums. Probably not the best for employers though. 
It would help if I submitted my assignments on time haha.  

The real repo name should be "J-Aragon-Developer-Portfolio"

I created this applcation so that I can showcase my best web projects.
